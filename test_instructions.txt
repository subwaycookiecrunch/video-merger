Video Merger Application - Test Instructions
==========================================

To test the video merger application, you'll need:

1. FFmpeg installed and added to your system PATH
   - Download from: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
   - For Windows: Extract the files and add the 'bin' folder to your system PATH
   - For macOS: Install with Homebrew using 'brew install ffmpeg'

2. A folder with video files (MP4, MKV, or MOV)

3. A PDF file containing the exact filenames of the videos you want to merge
   (including their extensions), in the order you want them merged

Example PDF content:
video1.mp4
scene2.mkv
clip3.mov

When you run the application:
1. Select the folder containing your video files
2. Select the PDF file with the filenames
3. Choose where to save the merged output
4. Click "Merge Videos" to start the process

The application will:
- Extract filenames from your PDF
- Match them with files in your video folder
- Copy matching files to a temporary directory with sequential names
- Create an FFmpeg concat list
- Merge the videos without re-encoding
- Save the result to your specified output location
